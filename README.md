# SharpTodo ![](View/Images/SharpTodoIcon32.png)
A WPF Application that brings the TodoList functionality of [Habitica.com](https://habitica.com/) to a faster, more compact, native application.

The goal is to build a way for Habitica Users to create and manage their Todos more quickly with a customizable UI and keyboard shortcuts.

Currently in development.
